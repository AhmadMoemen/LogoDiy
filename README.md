## Common Problems

### New boot logo does not take effect

This may happen with Photoshop saved `.jpg` format files. We recommend saving as `.bmp` format and using it directly, or converting to `.jpg` format with other software.

### User interface of this utility is too ugly ðŸ¤¯

This is actually just something I wanted to use for myself and quickly build, sorry.

### Any recommendations for boot logo design?

[Here](https://github.com/Coxxs/LogoDiy/tree/master/Examples) are some examples.
